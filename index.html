        <p>Last Christmas,<br>
            I gave You my heart.<br>
            But the very next day,<br>
            You gave it away.</p>

        <p>This year,<br>
            To save me from tears.<br>
            I'll give it,<br>
            To someone special.</p>

        <p><strong>Ref.:</strong><br>
            Last Christmas,<br>
            I gave You my heart.<br>
            But the very next day,<br>
            You gave it away (you gave it away).<br>
            This year,<br>
            To save me from tears.<br>
            I'll give it,<br>
            To someone special (special).</p>

            <p>Once bitten and twice shy.<br>
            I keep my distance,<br><br>
            But You still catch my eye.<br>
            Tell me, baby,<br>
            Do You recognize me?<br></p>

            <p>Well, it's been a year,<br>
            It doesn't surprise me.<br><br>
            Happy Christmas!<br></p>
            
            <p>I wrapped it up<br>
            And sent it<br>
            With a note saying,<br>
            "I love You,"<br>
            I meant it.<br></p>

            <p>Now I know what a fool I've been.<br>
            But if You kissed me now,<br>
            I know You'd fool me again.</p>
